=============================================================================
Network Packet Analyzer is a powerful tool designed for comprehensive network traffic analysis. It captures and analyzes network packets in real-time, providing users with deep insights into network behavior. Ideal for network administrators, security professionals, and developers, this tool aids in troubleshooting network issues, monitoring performance, and enhancing network security. By dissecting network packets, users can understand network protocols, identify bottlenecks, detect security anomalies, and visualize data flow. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with Suricata for advanced threat detection and supports capturing packets from nearby networks using monitoring mode. The tool also allows users to import and export packet capture files for collaborative analysis and record-keeping.

# Features:
## Real-time Packet Capture: 
Captures network packets in real-time for immediate network activity monitoring.
## Packet Dissection: 
Breaks down captured packets to reveal detailed information about network protocols, addresses, ports, and data payload.
## Protocol Analysis: 
Supports a wide range of network protocols (TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, DNS, etc.) for in-depth communication analysis across network layers.
## Filtering and Search: 
Allows users to efficiently analyze traffic by filtering packets based on specific criteria and searching for packets of interest.
## Statistics and Summaries: 
Provides statistical overviews of network traffic, including packet counts, protocol distribution, and bandwidth usage, for performance assessment.
## User-Friendly Interface: 
Features an intuitive graphical interface for easy packet capture, analysis, and data interpretation.
## Suricata Integration: 
Built-in integration with Suricata, a powerful intrusion detection system, to generate warnings and alerts based on detected network anomalies and potential threats.
## Import/Export Files:
Users can import and export packet capture files in standard formats (e.g., PCAP) for further analysis in other tools or for sharing and archival purposes.
## Nearby Network Capture (Monitoring Mode): 
**Leverages the monitoring mode of network adapters to capture packets from all nearby networks, not just the network the user is directly connected to, providing a broader network visibility.**
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
